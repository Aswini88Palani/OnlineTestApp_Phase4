Online Test Application.<br/>

DESCRIPTION <br/>

The Online Test Application system creates an application that enables users to provide online tests, review them, and display the results.<br/>

System Details <br/>
This system contains three main modules: Quiz, Review, and Result. <br/>
The quiz section of the online test application accepts the questions in JSON format. <br/>
The JSON file can be easily shared from the server in the pre-defined format. <br/>
The application renders the test at the client-side. <br/>
The “Review and display result” section allows users to declare the results immediately. <br/>
You can simply call another JSON with the answers in it and evaluate and display the results immediately.
